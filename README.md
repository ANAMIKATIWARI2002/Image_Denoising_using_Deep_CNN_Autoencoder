# Image_Denoising_using_Deep_CNN_Autoencoder

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of an image denoising application using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based deep autoencoder. The provided interface allows users to upload their noisy MNIST digit images and obtain denoised versions. The model is trained on pairs of noisy and clean MNIST digit images, learning to remove unwanted noise while preserving essential features.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application provides a simple and intuitive web interface for users to upload their noisy images and obtain denoised results.

- **CNN Deep Autoencoder:** The core denoising model is built using a Convolutional Neural Network with a deep autoencoder architecture. The model is trained on a dataset of noisy and clean image pairs to effectively remove noise while retaining important image details.

- **Easy Integration:** The codebase is designed for easy integration into existing projects or for further development. The denoising model can be trained on custom datasets, and the interface can be adapted for different applications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pillow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Keras
- tkinter

## Future Work

- **Color Image Denoising:** Extend the model to handle color images by adapting the architecture to handle multiple channels.

- **Optimization:** Explore techniques to optimize the model for faster inference without compromising denoising performance.

- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication for secure access to the denoising service.
